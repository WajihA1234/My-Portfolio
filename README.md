# My-Portfolio

I used the window.open() function to open my gitup and linkedIn profiles.
When a specific button is clicked on my navbar it brings you to that specific location on my page.
i also have a cursor pointer on hover.
the 3rd responsive action is my navbar/hamburger. i didnt figure out how to have it open up, but i made it hidden when on smaller screens
